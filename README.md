# Creating-an-MLP-ANN-from-Scratch-to-Solve-a-Regression-Task

The MLP trains and solves the regression task and both it's topology and hyperparameters are easily adjustable. They can be adjusted by changing the values of the attributes at the top of the MLP_Main Class.

This MLP has had many improvements made to the backpropagation algorithm including simulated annealing and momentum, which all provably improve performance.

To run, has to be imported into the eclipse IDE. It is the MLP_Main class that has to be run.

The output of the program is the RMSE of the trained MLP on the test data. (scroll to top of console to see the value for RMSE).
